"Instruction Set Architecture". See Patt 1.7.4
e.g. x86, ARM, RISC-V, MIPS
The ISA is responsible for defining the set of instructions to be supported by the processor. It is the assembly language for that processor. It is a level of abstraction above the [[Microarchitecture]] of the processor.

> An ISA describes  the interface to the computer  from the perspective  of the 0s and 1s of  the program.  For example,  it describes the operations,  data types,  and addressing modes a programmer can use on that particular computer. It doesnâ€™t specify the actual physical implementation. The microarchitecture does that. Using the car analogy, the ISA is what the driver sees, and the microarchitecture is what goes on under the hood.
