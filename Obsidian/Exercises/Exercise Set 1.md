### 1.16
Name at least three things speciﬁed by an ISA.
### 1.17
Brieﬂy describe the diﬀerence between an ISA and a
microarchitecture.
### 1.18
How many ISAs are normally implemented by a single
microarchitecture? Conversely, how many microarchitectures could exist for a single ISA?
### 1.23
Why is an ISA unlikely to change between successive generations
of microarchitectures that implement it? For example, why would Intel
want to make certain that the ISA implemented by the Pentium III is
the same as the one implemented by the Pentium II? Hint: When you
upgrade your computer (or buy one with a newer CPU), do you need to
throw out all your old software?
