### 2.1
Given n bits, how many distinct combinations of the n bits exist?
> [!solution]-
$2^n$
### 2.2
There are 26 characters in the alphabet we use for writing English. What
is the least number of bits needed to give each character a unique bit
pattern? How many bits would we need to distinguish between upper-
and lowercase versions of all 26 characters?
> [!solution]-
> * $26$ unique chars needs a minimum of $32=2^5$ combos -> 5 bits
> * $52$ chars needs $64 = 2^6$ combos -> 6 bits
